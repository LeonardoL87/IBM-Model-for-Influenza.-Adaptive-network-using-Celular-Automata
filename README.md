# IBM-Model-for-Influenza.-Adaptive-network-using-Celular-Automata
IBM Model using adaptive co-evolutionary networks.
The next code corresponds to the dynamics of influenza virus, on this script we invocate each function corresponding to each phase of dynamics (individual behaviour, social behaviour and health state).
The Run.m scrip is the main function and you can use it to run your simulations. Inside each script, youâ€™ll find the comments about the functionality and configuration.
